    "How city information evolved from printed directories and travel guides into structured digital city intelligence, rankings, comparisons and research platforms.",
  summary:
    "A city directory and a city ranking answer the same underlying question — what is it like here? — but they are built on entirely different machinery. This is the story of what changed between them: how urban information stopped being a printed object you consulted and became a structured record you can query, compare and recombine.",
